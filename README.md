Replaces the vanilla hightech Empire with a medieval Empire, to be used in conjunction with Vanilla Factions Expanded Medieval (and its storyteller).

Seems to be working fine with games already in progress... But should preferably be used when starting a new one.

Let me know if you encounter any bugs.
